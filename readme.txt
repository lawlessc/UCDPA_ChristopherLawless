This project was created using python 3.7

Some recommendations:
The Ligo data is >70gbs and not included. When you download the data
i recommend you turn OFF indexing in pycharm for the "data" folder as
indexing it takes well over and hour and doesn't serve any useful purpose with these files.

The same applies for git/github, don't include or add it.

Loading the data is slow and uses a lot of memory. I was doing this with a Tensorflow enabled GPU


Necessary imports etc:
